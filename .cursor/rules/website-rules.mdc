Next.js React TypeScript
You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Bootstrap.

DO NOT USE TAILWIND USE BOOTSTRAP.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Bootsrap for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Bootstrap CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Information About the Project
- AI-Driven Agent Integrated Support Solution
We offer an innovative, AI agent-based product designed to reduce support burdens for companies with multiple employees as well as solo entrepreneurs facing increased support demands. Our solution integrates both internal and outsourced (outbound) support functionalities to streamline operations and optimize resource allocation.

- Automated First Response:
 Our product processes data from an extensive and continuously updated knowledge base, enabling it to serve as the first line of defense by addressing inquiries and requests without human intervention. The knowledge base can be expanded and updated continuously to achieve increasingly effective results, with no theoretical limits on its potential.

- Efficient Workflow Automation:
 With specialized agent workflows, repetitive tasks are fully automated, freeing up human resources to focus on more critical and strategic areas. Communication between agents further enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the process.

- Dynamic Support Structure:
 Outbound agents are primarily responsible for customer support and can seamlessly escalate issues to human agents when necessary. Additionally, these agents can interact with internal agents to contribute to company-wide planning and automation initiatives.

- Global Integration and Swift Migration:
 The product supports integration with popular platforms such as Zapier, Make.com, and others, offering a globally effective solution. We provide comprehensive assistance during the migration of active products, ensuring an exceptionally swift transition to the new system.

- Multi-Channel Deployment:
 Our solution can be deployed across various channels—WordPress, WhatsApp, Messenger, Discord, Slack, websites, and more—delivering consistent, high-quality support to users in every environment.

- This solution automates customer support processes, allowing businesses and solo entrepreneurs to utilize their resources more efficiently and concentrate on strategic, value-adding tasks.

- Competitive Advantage
Our competitive edge lies in our commitment to unparalleled usability. Unlike many competitors, our platform is designed so that even non-technical users can effortlessly create and deploy AI agents to automate both outbound customer support and internal workflow processes. This ease-of-use is achieved through an intuitive interface, comprehensive onboarding resources, and step-by-step guidance, empowering any organization to streamline support functions without the need for specialized technical skills. In essence, our solution not only reduces operational burdens but also democratizes advanced automation technology, allowing businesses of all sizes to focus on strategic growth and innovation.

- Initial Growth Plan
We are initially focusing on establishing a robust presence in Turkey by integrating leading e-commerce platforms such as Trendyol and Hepsiburada with our AI-driven agents and chatbots. This integration will enable seamless, automated support for both customers and internal teams on product inquiries, delivery tracking, and related issues—eliminating the need for human intervention.
Our research reveals that no current project in Turkey offers this comprehensive solution. By studying the impressive growth of similar tools in the U.S. market—particularly those designed for platforms like Amazon and Shopify—we are confident in the significant market potential for our solution.
Furthermore, we believe that this innovative approach has ample room to expand, not only in Turkey but also throughout Europe and the Middle East, paving the way for a transformative shift in customer and internal support services.
